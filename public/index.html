    `GET /leads` - Returns a list of `Lead` objects in the database, paginated. The query params for pagination can be of your choice.
    <br>
`GET /leads/{id}` - Returns a `Lead` object with the specific lead id supplied as path param.
<br>
`POST /leads` - Send a JSON request body for lead creation with `Lead` objects. Returns status `201 created` on successful creation, or status `409 conflict` on duplication.
<br>
`POST /leads/bulk` - Send a CSV file as request body with `Lead` objects. Returns a JSON object with the stats of the bulk upload, e.g.
<br>
```json<br>
{<br>
	"created": 230,<br>
	"duplicates": 46,<br>
	"error": 12,<br>
	"report": "{base_url}/reports/{uuid}"<br>
}<br>
```
<br>
The `report` key contains a link which can be used to download a `CSV` which contains all the error and duplicated records, so that the user can easily modify, fix and upload it back quickly.
